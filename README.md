Data Analysis of KCSE results for KamiLimu ICT Track

## Overview
A dataset of KCSE results over a couple of years was presented and required to be analysed.

I analysed the data using Python Programming Language using PyCharm.
Pandas library and Matplotlib for Data Visualization.

This is what I did withthe data:-

1. Checked the data if it had any missing values or if the data had wrongly named values and cleaned it.
2. Sorted the data based on gender and year and compared the results based on these parameters.
3. Compared the results based on those who qualified to join University (Grades A - C+) and those who did not (Grades C - E)
4. Compared the number of candidates over the years.
5. Found the most common grades among both genders.
